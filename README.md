Symfony2 Basic Project
========================

This is a basic Symfony2 framework v2.1.7 with the popular FOSUserBundle
installed and configured to work with MySQL


1) Installing the Standard Edition
----------------------------------

If you downloaded an archive "without vendors", you also need to install all
the necessary dependencies. Download composer (see above) and run the
following command:

    php composer.phar install

2) Checking your System Configuration
-------------------------------------

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for Symfony.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php
